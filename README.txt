# Herbybot: Miniature Robot Platform for Automating Urban Hydroponic Growing


## SUMMARY

This research addresses sustainable food production challenges posed by global population growth and harsh local conditions through the development of miniature robots for hydroponic farming. These 3D printed robots traverse horizontally-oriented tubular hydroponic systems along the outside of the pipes, providing a mobile and stable platform to support plant lifecycle management. Designed for inaccessible setups, the robots operate independently, even at height, offering automation and precision beyond manual methods. Grounded in Open Hardware principles, the platform is solder-free, built using readily available components, and printable on basic 3D printers, ensuring affordability and adaptability. The robots, controlled by an Arduino-based system, deliver optimised motility, stability, power efficiency and reliability, while enabling nutrient delivery, pest control and environmental monitoring. The open-source design promotes transparency, reproducibility and community uptake, encouraging growers, designers, and engineers to build, deploy, and improve functionality without proprietary restrictions. The robot is capable of operating continuously over a tested time period of seven days to record growth of plants through photography and targeted spraying of a feed solution onto plants leaves without requiring human intervention.
